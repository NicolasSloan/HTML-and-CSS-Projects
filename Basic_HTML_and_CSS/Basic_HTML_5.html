			<h3> What is an article tag?<h3>
			<p>Articles are used to group content together that is related, and it should also contain a heading.<br>
			It should also be self-contained, meaning it can be separated from the rest of the document and still be meaningful</p>
		</article>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Details and summary tag</summary>
			<p> The details tag is used to specify additional data that the user can open and close. <br>
			It is closed by default. The summary tag is used to define a visible heading for the details element</p>
		</details>
		
		<p>The time tag is used to define a specific time, such as <time>14:00</time>.<br>
		You can then use the datetime attribute to translate the time into a machine readable format.<br>
		This allows browsers to offer date reminders through calenders, or help search engines produce smarter results<br>
		Here is an example, my birthday is <time datetime="2001-12-22 12:00">December 22nd, 2001</time>.
