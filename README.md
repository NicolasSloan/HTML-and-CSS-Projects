# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is for my Tech Academy HTML and CSS Course Projects
Below is a summary of al of my projects I've worked on within it.

# Nintendo Console History
This is a one-page website I made to practice using HTML and CSS, I decided to give it a bit of customization from the original project with my own spin on it.

# Bootstrap 4 Project-Academy cinemas
This was practice using bootstrap 4 assests to create a movie theater website

# Portfolio Website
This is a copy of what is included in my portfolio repository, and is my initial draft of my portfolio website which is live [here](NicolasSloan.com)

# Miscellaneous
The rest of this repository is miscellaneous practice using HTML and CSS together, and a small bit of Javascript. It's mostly incomplete webpages that were used to test only a few elements at a time.
